            I started programming after <b>10th grade</b> with <b>C</b>. Then I began solving problems on online judges
            such as
            <E href="https://codeforces.com/">Codeforces</E>,
            <E href="https://lightoj.com/">LightOJ</E>,
            <E href="https://leetcode.com">LeetCode</E>,
            <E href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</E>
            etc regularly. During that time, I solved over <b>1000+ unique problems</b> across various platforms. You can
            find the code for those problems solution on below link
            <br />
            <R href="https://github.com/mt-shihab26/problem_library">Problem Library</R>
            <br />
            <br />
            Along with <b>problem-solving</b>, I studied <b>data structures</b> and
            <b>algorithms</b>, and applied that knowledge to solve problems. You can find my implementations of data
            structures and algorithms on below link
            <br />
            <R href="https://github.com/mt-shihab26/dsa_library">DSA Library</R>
            <br />
            <br />
            I also regularly read <i>programming-related books</i>. Here you can find the
            <b>source code</b>, <b>practice exercises</b>, and <b>notes</b> from those books as markdown files on below link

        After high school, I began programming with <b>C</b>, inspired by Tamim Shahriar Subeen's <b
            >Computer Programming</b
        >. I honed my skills by solving
        <i>1100+ problems</i> on competitive programming platforms using <i>C/C++</i>, gaining a
        strong foundation in <b>Data Structures and Algorithms</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Later, I transitioned to web development, starting with <i>Node.js</i> and
        <i>React</i>, and now specialize in <i>Laravel</i> and <i>React</i> for building dynamic full-stack
        applications. I also have experience in
        <i>WordPress plugin development</i> and have worked contractually with
        <a href="https://finnext.co" target="_blank">
            <i>Finnext</i>
        </a>
        on several notable projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I am a <i>4th-year Computer Science student</i> at
        <b>Faridpur Polytechnic Institute</b>. Outside of coding, I enjoy <b>walking</b>,
        <b>movies</b>, <b>socializing</b>, and
        <b>learning about business and entrepreneurship</b>. I'm actively seeking a <i
            >full-time software developer role</i
        >.
    </p>
    <p>
        My technical journey has led me to develop expertise in modern web technologies including <i
            >TypeScript</i
        >, <i>Next.js</i>, and <i>Tailwind CSS</i>. I've built several full-stack applications
        incorporating <b>RESTful APIs</b>,
        <b>database design</b>, and <b>authentication systems</b>. I'm particularly proud of
        implementing complex features like real-time notifications and payment integrations.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a developer, I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and following best practices
        like <b>SOLID principles</b> and <b>test-driven development</b>. I'm experienced with modern
        development workflows using <i>Git</i>,
        <i>Docker</i>, and <i>CI/CD pipelines</i>. I enjoy mentoring junior developers and
        contributing to open-source projects whenever possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        My goal is to join a forward-thinking team where I can contribute to meaningful projects
        while continuing to grow as a developer. I'm particularly interested in opportunities that
        involve <b>cloud technologies</b>, <b>microservices architecture</b>, and <b
            >emerging web standards</b
        >.

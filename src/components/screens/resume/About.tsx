                After graduating from high school, I was introduced to programming through the
                internet. I began learning programming with the <B>C language</B>, using Tamim
                Shahriar Subeen's book "Computer Programming". Subsequently, I engaged in{" "}
                <B>problem-solving</B> on various Competitive Programming platforms using{" "}
                <B>C/C++</B>. Over a period of 1.5 years, I solved over <B>1100+ problems</B>.
                During problem-solving, I also learned Data Structure And Algorithms My interest
                then shifted towards Web application development, prompting me to initially delve
                into backend development with <B>Node.js</B>, followed by frontend development with{" "}
                <B>React</B>. Over the past year, I have been engaged in contract-based work with a
                company called Finnext.co, where I have contributed to several notable projects.
                Currently, my focus lies on <B>Laravel</B>& <B>React</B> stacks. I believe it is the
                most productive way to build and maintain a dynamic full-stack web application.
                Also, sometime I work on <B>WordPress plugin development</B>. I am deeply passionate
                about continuously expanding my skill set and am actively seeking a full-time
                position as a software developer. Also I am currently a 4th year diploma student at
                Faridpur Polytechnic Institute studying <B>Computer Science</B>. When I'm not
                coding, I enjoy walking on street, watching movies, and chat with friends and
                family. I also enjoy learning new things. I am currently learning about Business &
                Entrepreneurship.

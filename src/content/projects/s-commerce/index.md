A feature-rich single-vendor eCommerce platform developed with [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
during a two-month internship at [Systech Digital Limited](https://systechdigital.com).
The application combines Laravel's powerful backend capabilities with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
for the admin dashboard and integrates [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev) for enhanced frontend interactivity.

The platform offers comprehensive eCommerce functionality including advanced product
filtering, a robust shopping cart system, and seamless payment processing through [SSLCommerz](https://sslcommerz.com)
gateway integration supporting multiple payment methods. The customer-facing features include detailed
account management, order tracking, and a responsive shopping interface, while the admin dashboard
provides complete control over products, categories, users, coupons, and site customization.

Key technical implementations include a sophisticated authentication system with email verification and password reset capabilities, district-wise delivery charge management for Bangladesh, and efficient database operations using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org). The admin interface, built from scratch using TailwindCSS, offers intuitive management of products, orders, users, and marketing elements like news flashes and hero sliders.

This project demonstrates the ability to develop eCommerce solution that follows industry best practices in web development. The codebase is well-structured, maintainable, and built to scale, making it an ideal foundation for customizable online retail platforms.

The entire project is open-source and thoroughly documented, showcasing both technical expertise in full-stack web development and practical understanding of eCommerce business requirements.

## Overview

The **Student Performance Monitoring System** is a web-based application developed using raw [PHP](https://php.net). This system was designed to assist educators and administrators in monitoring and tracking students' academic performance efficiently. The application provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies the collection, analysis, and visualization of student performance data, enabling informed decision-making to enhance educational outcomes.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project was to create an intuitive platform for educational institutions to manage student information, track academic performance, and generate insightful reports. This project was undertaken as part of an internship at [Systech Digital Limited](https://systechdigital.com), and it involved building a web application using raw [PHP](https://php.net). The system aims to streamline administrative tasks, improve data accuracy, and provide actionable insights through performance visualizations.

## Key Features

1. **Student Management**:
    - Add, update, and delete student information.
    - Manage student profiles and academic records.
2. **Performance Tracking**:
    - Record and view students' grades, attendance, and other performance metrics.
    - Track progress over time to identify trends and areas for improvement.
3. **Reporting**:
    - Generate detailed reports on individual and group performance.
    - Export reports for offline analysis and record-keeping.
4. **Visualization**:
    - Visualize performance data through charts and graphs.
    - Use visual aids to quickly interpret and communicate student progress.
5. **User Authentication**:
    - Secure login for administrators, teachers, and students.
    - Ensure data privacy and security through role-based access control.
6. **Notifications**:
    - Automated alerts for performance issues or achievements.
    - Keep stakeholders informed about important updates and milestones.

## Technologies Used

The system was developed using raw PHP. I aimed to build a structured system by following a [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework-like folder structure. Key technologies and tools used include:

-   [**PDO**](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php): To connect with the MySQL database.
-   [**Composer**](https://getcomposer.org): To manage dependencies and install packages.
-   [**spatie/browsershot**](https://github.com/spatie/browsershot): To generate PDFs.
-   [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com): To style the application.

## Conclusion

The development of the Student Performance Monitoring System demonstrates my ability to create effective and user-centric web applications with raw PHP. By addressing the specific needs of educational institutions, this project showcases my skills in PHP development, database design, and user interface design. This case study highlights my commitment to delivering solutions that make a tangible difference in real-world scenarios.

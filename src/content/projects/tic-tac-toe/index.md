A sophisticated implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using SolidJS,
featuring an unbeatable AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm.

The game combines the reactive performance of SolidJS with TypeScript's type safety
and TailwindCSS's utility-first styling to create a smooth, responsive gaming experience.

Players can challenge the AI opponent, which uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal
moves, ensuring a challenging gameplay experience. The project demonstrates practical application of artificial intelligence concepts in web development while showcasing modern front-end development practices.

The implementation features clean, maintainable code architecture and an intuitive
user interface that works seamlessly across different devices.

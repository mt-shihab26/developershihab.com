                        After high school, I began programming with <b>C</b>, inspired by Tamim
                        Shahriar Subeen's <b>Computer Programming</b>. I honed my skills by solving
                        <i>1100+ problems</i> on competitive programming platforms using <i>C/C++</i
                        >, gaining a strong foundation in <b>Data Structures and Algorithms</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later, I transitioned to web development, starting with <i>Node.js</i> and
                        <i>React</i>, and now specialize in <i>Laravel</i> and <i>React</i> for building
                        dynamic full-stack applications. I also have experience in
                        <i>WordPress plugin development</i> and have worked contractually with
                        <a href="https://finnext.co" target="_blank">
                            <i>Finnext</i>
                        </a>
                        on several notable projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I am a <i>4th-year Computer Science student</i> at
                        <b>Faridpur Polytechnic Institute</b>. Outside of coding, I enjoy <b
                            >walking</b
                        >,
                        <b>movies</b>, <b>socializing</b>, and
                        <b>learning about business and entrepreneurship</b>. I'm actively seeking a <i
                            >full-time software developer role</i
                        >.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My technical journey has led me to develop expertise in modern web
                        technologies including <i>TypeScript</i>, <i>Next.js</i>, and <i
                            >Tailwind CSS</i
                        >. I've built several full-stack applications incorporating <b
                            >RESTful APIs</b
                        >,
                        <b>database design</b>, and <b>authentication systems</b>. I'm particularly
                        proud of implementing complex features like real-time notifications and
                        payment integrations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a developer, I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and following
                        best practices like <b>SOLID principles</b> and <b
                            >test-driven development</b
                        >. I'm experienced with modern development workflows using <i>Git</i>,
                        <i>Docker</i>, and <i>CI/CD pipelines</i>. I enjoy mentoring junior
                        developers and contributing to open-source projects whenever possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My goal is to join a forward-thinking team where I can contribute to
                        meaningful projects while continuing to grow as a developer. I'm
                        particularly interested in opportunities that involve <b
                            >cloud technologies</b
                        >, <b>microservices architecture</b>, and <b>emerging web standards</b>.
